# How does the website work?

The website consists of three code files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

HTML is the code file that provides the structure of the website. All the buttons, text field, images etc are all programmed in the HTML file in .html format. 

CSS is the code file that provides the styles to the website. It styles all the structure and the page of the website to make it look like the website that you want. 

JavaScript is the code file that give the functionality to the website. It gives the structure functions and make things perform action.

To give it a proper analogy:

When you are building a house, HTML provides the structure of the house, includes all the furniture, accessories, garden etc. However, all these items and infrastructure are colourless in its default shape and state. CSS provides the color, shape and state of all the structure and items. It also dictates where all these items will be places in the house. JavaScript is the electrician that comes in and provides electricity to the house, giving the items and structure a function to perform when you use the items.

All these items are retrieved from the server when your computer (client) request for the information from the host IP address.

The web page that is shown in the browser is the local code base that you have retrieved and displayed in your local computer. You can make changes to the code base locally when you inspect the web page on your browser. However, when you refresh the page, the browser will send a request based on the URL stated in the domain again, retrieving a new set of code files that will be shown again in the browser.
